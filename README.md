Test Method:
- >> Used IQR to identify outliers 
- >> Removed Outliers and tripped down the number of categories by eliminating those that were not viable 
- >> Next: Conduct Multiple Linear Regression on different models using a variation of subsets of the variables available 
- >> Compare and Contrast promising models & select the best one

Findings:
- TBD
